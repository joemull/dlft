PREFACE 
The Literature of Love finds its best expression in 
Poetry, the language of emotion. So voluminous is this 
literature, corresponding as it does to the universality of 
the emotion, that it would seem that no novelty of poetic 
expression were left the modern lover who would indite a 
sonnet to his mistress eye-brow or turn a couplet in -praise 
of her less obvious charms. 
From the "Song of Solomon " to the " Songs of Swinburne" 
has welled up a chorus of songs by major and 
minor poets that would daunt the spirit of the bravest 
anthologist. No adequate anthology were indeed possible 
without qualifying limitations of a most definite kind. 
The limitation imposed in this little collection is that 
of Constancy in relation to the poetry of love; the idea of 
Constancy is still further qualified by limitation to the 
loves of men and women for one another. 
liven within these narrow bounds this collection is not 
exhaustive ; but it is believed to be the only collection of its 
kind, and it is hoped that it will meet with the approval 
of all who seek a fitting expression of the sentiments to 
which this collection is dedicated. 
A note of variety has been introduced by placing an 
appropriate motto at the fool of each page, arranged in 
alphabetical order. These mottoes or ring posies were in 
olden times engraved on engagement and wedding rings. 
Thanks are due various publishers for permission to 
use copyrighted poems.

[Body] 
TWO lovers by a moss-grown spring, 
* They leaned soft cheeks together there, 
Mingled the dark and sunny hair, 
And heard the ■wooing thrushes sing. 
() budding time! 
() love's best prime! 
Two wedded from the portal slept; 
The bells made happy carollings, 
The air was soft as fanning wings, 
While petals on the pathway slept. 
O pure-eyed bride! 
() tender pride ! 
Two faces o'er a cradle bent; 
Two hands above the head were locked; 
These pressed each other while they rocked, 
Those watched a life that love had sent. 
() solemn hour! 
O hidden power! 
I 
?r 
A-Friend-Indeed-in-Tyme-of-Need 
I 
Two parents by the evening fire; 
The red light fell about their knees 
On heads that rose by slow degrees 
Like buds upon the lily spire. 
O patient life ! 
O tender strife ! 
The two still sat together there, 
The red light shone about their knees; 
But all the heads by slow degrees 
Had gone and left that lonely pair. 
O voyage fast 
O vanished past ! 
The red light shone upon the floor, 
And made the space between them wide; 
They drew their chairs up side by side, 
Their pale cheeks joined, and said, "Once more!" 
O memories ' 
O past that is! 
Eliot.

A-Friend-To-One-As-Like-To-None 
Won't flou? 
DO you remember when you heard 
My lips breathe love's first faltering word? 
You do, sweet — don't you ? 
When, having wandered all the day, 
Linked arm in arm, I dared to say: 
"You '11 love me — won't you?" 
And when you blushed and could not speak, 
I fondly kissed your glowing cheek; 
Did that affront you? 
Oh! surely not; your eye exprest 
No wrath — but said perhaps in jest: 
"'You '11 love me — won't you?" 
I'm sure my eyes replied, "I will;" 
And you believe that promise still; 
You do, sweet — don't you? 
Yes, yes, when age has made our eyes 
Unfit for questions or replies, 
You '11 love me — won't you?

A-Fr iend-to-Thee-F 11-Ever-Be 
A Woman's (jputattmt 
F^O you know you have asked for the cost*-' 
liest thing 
Ever made by the hand above — 
A woman's heart and a woman's life, 
And a woman's wonderful love ? 
Do you know you have asked for this priceless 
thing 
As a child might ask for a toy? 
Demanding what others have died to win, 
With the reckless dash of a boy. 
You have written my lesson of duty out; 
Manlike, you have questioned me. 
Now stand at the bar of my woman's soul, 
Until I shall question thee. 
24 
A-Happy-Brest-Where-Love-Doth-Rest 
You require your mutton shall always be hot, 
Your socks and your shirts be whole; 
I require your heart shall be true as God's stars, 
And pure as heaven your soul. 
You require a cook for your mutton and beef; 
I require a far better thing. 
A seamstress you 're wanting, for stockings and 
shirts; 
I look for a man, and a king. 
A king for a beautiful realm called home, 
And a man that the maker, God, 
Shall look upon as He did the first, 
And say, "It is very good." 
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade 
From my soft, young cheek one day; 
Will you love me then, 'mid the falling leaves, 
As you did 'mid the bloom of May? 
25 
A-Heart-Content-Cannot-Repent 
Is your heart an ocean, so strong and deep 
I may launch my all on its tide? 
A. loving woman finds heaven or hell 
On the day she is made a bride. 
I require all things that are grand and true, 
All things that a man should be; 
If you give this all, I would stake my life 
To be all you demand of me. 
If you cannot do this, a laundress and cook 
You can hire, with little to pay; 
But a woman's heart and a woman's life 
Are not to be won that way. 
Airs. Browning.
