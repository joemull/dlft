PREFACE 
The Literature of Love finds its best expression in 
Poetry, the language of emotion. So voluminous is this 
literature, corresponding as it does to the universality of 
the emotion, that it would seem that no novelty of poetic 
expression were left the modern lover who would indite a 
sonnet to his mistress eye-brow or turn a couplet in -praise 
of her less obvious charms. 
From the "Song of Solomon " to the " Songs of Swinburne" 
has welled up a chorus of songs by major and 
minor poets that would daunt the spirit of the bravest 
anthologist. No adequate anthology were indeed possible 
without qualifying limitations of a most definite kind. 
The limitation imposed in this little collection is that 
of Constancy in relation to the poetry of love; the idea of 
Constancy is still further qualified by limitation to the 
loves of men and women for one another. 
liven within these narrow bounds this collection is not 
exhaustive ; but it is believed to be the only collection of its 
kind, and it is hoped that it will meet with the approval 
of all who seek a fitting expression of the sentiments to 
which this collection is dedicated. 
A note of variety has been introduced by placing an 
appropriate motto at the fool of each page, arranged in 
alphabetical order. These mottoes or ring posies were in 
olden times engraved on engagement and wedding rings. 
Thanks are due various publishers for permission to 
use copyrighted poems.

[Body] 
TWO lovers by a moss-grown spring, 
* They leaned soft cheeks together there, 
Mingled the dark and sunny hair, 
And heard the ■wooing thrushes sing. 
() budding time! 
() love's best prime! 
Two wedded from the portal slept; 
The bells made happy carollings, 
The air was soft as fanning wings, 
While petals on the pathway slept. 
O pure-eyed bride! 
() tender pride ! 
Two faces o'er a cradle bent; 
Two hands above the head were locked; 
These pressed each other while they rocked, 
Those watched a life that love had sent. 
() solemn hour! 
O hidden power! 
I

Two parents by the evening fire; 
The red light fell about their knees 
On heads that rose by slow degrees 
Like buds upon the lily spire. 
O patient life ! 
O tender strife ! 
The two still sat together there, 
The red light shone about their knees; 
But all the heads by slow degrees 
Had gone and left that lonely pair. 
O voyage fast 
O vanished past ! 
The red light shone upon the floor, 
And made the space between them wide; 
They drew their chairs up side by side, 
Their pale cheeks joined, and said, "Once more!" 
O memories ' 
O past that is! 
Eliot.

A-Friend-To-One-As-Like-To-None 
Won't flou? 
DO you remember when you heard 
My lips breathe love's first faltering word? 
You do, sweet — don't you ? 
When, having wandered all the day, 
Linked arm in arm, I dared to say: 
"You '11 love me — won't you?" 
And when you blushed and could not speak, 
I fondly kissed your glowing cheek; 
Did that affront you? 
Oh! surely not; your eye exprest 
No wrath — but said perhaps in jest: 
"'You '11 love me — won't you?" 
I'm sure my eyes replied, "I will;" 
And you believe that promise still; 
You do, sweet — don't you? 
Yes, yes, when age has made our eyes 
Unfit for questions or replies, 
You '11 love me — won't you?

F^O you know you have asked for the cost*-' 
liest thing 
Ever made by the hand above — 
A woman's heart and a woman's life, 
And a woman's wonderful love ? 
Do you know you have asked for this priceless 
thing 
As a child might ask for a toy? 
Demanding what others have died to win, 
With the reckless dash of a boy. 
You have written my lesson of duty out; 
Manlike, you have questioned me. 
Now stand at the bar of my woman's soul, 
Until I shall question thee.

A-Happy-Brest-Where-Love-Doth-Rest 
You require your mutton shall always be hot, 
Your socks and your shirts be whole; 
I require your heart shall be true as God's stars, 
And pure as heaven your soul. 
You require a cook for your mutton and beef; 
I require a far better thing. 
A seamstress you 're wanting, for stockings and 
shirts; 
I look for a man, and a king. 
A king for a beautiful realm called home, 
And a man that the maker, God, 
Shall look upon as He did the first, 
And say, "It is very good." 
I am fair and young, but the rose will fade 
From my soft, young cheek one day; 
Will you love me then, 'mid the falling leaves, 
As you did 'mid the bloom of May? 
25 
A-Heart-Content-Cannot-Repent 
Is your heart an ocean, so strong and deep 
I may launch my all on its tide? 
A. loving woman finds heaven or hell 
On the day she is made a bride. 
I require all things that are grand and true, 
All things that a man should be; 
If you give this all, I would stake my life 
To be all you demand of me. 
If you cannot do this, a laundress and cook 
You can hire, with little to pay; 
But a woman's heart and a woman's life 
Are not to be won that way. 
Airs. Browning.

WERE I as base as is the lowly plain, 
And you, my Love, as high as heaven

Ascend to heaven, in honour of my Love. 
Were I as high as heaven above the plain, 
And you, my Love, as humbl and as low 
As are the deepest bottoms of the main, 
Whereso'er you were, with you my love should go. 
Were you the earth, dear Love, and I the skies, 
My love should shine on you like to the sun, 
And look upon you with ten thousand eyes 
Till heaven wax'd blind, and till the world weredone. 
Whereso'er I am, below, or else above you, 
Whereso'er you are, my heart shall truly love you

Hard and sorrowful then was I — 
Ah! lad, how you cheered me then, 
Things will be better, sweet wife, again! 
Always the same, Darby, my own, 
Always the same to your old wife Joan.

Hand in hand when our hair is gray,

Hand in hand when the long night tide 
Gently covers us side by side — 
Ah ! lad, though we know not when, 
Love will be with us forever then; 
Always the same, Darby, my own, 
Always the same to your old wife Joan,

In the atmosphere 
Of a new-fall'n year, 
Whose white and sable hours appear 
The latest flake of Eternity; 
So many times do I love thee, dear. 
How many times do I love, again ? 
Tell me how many beads there are 
In a silver chain 
Of the evening rain,

And threading the eye of a yellow star; 
So many times do I love again.

IXISSING her hair I sat against her feet, 
Wove and unwove it, wound and found it 
sweet; 
Made fast therewith her hands, drew down her 
eyes, 
Deep as deep flowers and dreamy like dim skies; 
With her own tresses bound and found her fair, 
Kissing her hair. 
Sleep were no sweeter than her face to me. 
Sleep of cold sea-bloom under the cold sea; 
What pain could get between my face and hers? 
What new sweet thing would love not relish 
"worse ? 
Unless, perhaps, white death had kissed me there, 
Kissing her hair?

r*\OST thou remember that place so lonely, 
*—^ A place for lovers, and lovers only, 
Where first I told thee all my secret sighs? 
When as the moonbeam, that trembled o'er thee, 
Illumed thy blushes, I knelt before thee, 
And read my hope's sweet triumph in those eyes? 
Then, then, while closely heart was drawn to heart, 
Love bound us — never, never more to part ! 
And when I call'd thee by names the dearest 
That love could fancy, the fondest, nearest — 
"My life, my only life!" among the rest; 
In those sweet accents that still inthral me, 
Thou saidst, "Ah! wherefore thy life thus call me? 
Thy soul, thy soul's the name that I love best; 
For life soon passes — but how bless'd to be 
That soul which never, never parts from thee!" 
Moore.

THIRST time he kissed me, he but only kissed 
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write, 
And ever since it grew more clean and white, 
Slow to world greetings — quick with its "Oh, list," 
When the angels spsak. A ring of amethyst 
I could not wear here plainer to my sight, 
Than that first kiss. The second passed in height 
The first, and sought the forehead, and ha'.f missed, 
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed! 
That was the chrism of love, which love's own 
\ 
crown, 
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede. 
The third, upon my lips, was folded down 
In perfect, purple state ! since when, indeed, 
I have been proud and said, "My Love, my own."

Mot overcome with grief, but strong in the hour

Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running 
to meet him, 
Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his

Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances 
may happen!"

"THEY sin who tell us love can die, 
With life all other passions fly, 
All others are but vanity; 
In heaven ambition cannot dwell, 
Nor avarice in the vaults of hell; 
Earthly these passions of the earth, 
They perish where they have their birth; 
Hut love is indestructible: 
Its holy flame forever burneth; 
From heaven it came, to heaven returneth 
Too oft on earth a troubled guest, 
At times deceived, at times oppressed, 
It here is tried and purified, 
Then hath in heaven its perfect rest: 
It soweth here with toil and care, 
Jkit the harvest-time of love is there. 
38 
Oh! when a mother meets on high 
The babe she lost in infancy, 
Hath she not then, for pains and fears, 
The day of woe, the watchful night, 
For all her sorrow, all her tears, 
An over-payment of delight. 
Southey

And so I shyly kissed her; 
Love laughed along the river'

She loves, and loves for ever. 
Oh! say not woman's false as fair, 
That like the bee she ranges; 
Still seeking flowers more sweet and rare, 
As fickle fancy changes.

Give me as my wife this maiden, 
Minnehaha, Laughing Water,

And the ancient Arrow-maker 
Paused a moment ere he answered, 
Smoked a little while in silence, 
Looked at Hiawatha proudly, 
Fondly looked at Laughing Water, 
And made answer very gravely: 
"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes; 
Let your heart speak, Minnehaha ! " 
And the lovely Laughing Water

Thus it was he won the daughter 
Of the ancient Arrow-maker, 
In the land of the Dacotahs! 
From the wigwam he departed, 
Leading with him Laughing Water; 
Hand in hand they went together, 
Through the woodland and the meadow 
Left the old man standing lonely 
At the doorway of his wigwam, 
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha 
Calling to them from the distance, 
Crying to them from afar off, 
"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"

As the long hours pass away ? 
Will it stretch if Fate divide us, 
When dark and weary hours have tried us ? 
Oh, if it look too poor and slight, 
Let us break the links to-night ! 
It was not forged by mortal hands, 
Or clasped with golden bars and bands; 
Save thine and mine, no other eyes 
The slender link can recognize: 
In the bright light it seems to fade, 
And it is hidden in the shade; 
While Heaven nor Earth have never heard

Because too sacred and divine 
For other eyes, save thine and mine. 
And see! though slender, it is made 
.Of Love and Trust, and can they fade? 
While, if too slight it seem, to bear 
The breathings of the summer air, 
We know that it could bear the weight 
Of a most heavy heart of late, 
And as each day and hour flew 
The stronger for its burthen grew.

When earthly ties and bonds are past; 
What slighter things dare not endure 
Will make our Love more safe and pure. 
Love shall be purified by Pain, 
And Pain be soothed by Love again: 
So let us now take heart and go 
Cheerfully on through joy and woe: 
No change the summer sun can bring,

What thou dost foist upon us that is old: 
And rather make them born to our desire 
Than think that we before have heard them told. 
Thy registers and thee I both defy, 
Not wondering at the present nor the past, 
For thy records and what we see doth lie, 
Made more or less by thy continual haste. 
This I do vow, and this shall ever be, 
I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.

And your soft hands are trembling in my 
own, 
To loving bliss I leave my yearning soul, 
And let the happy hours unheeded roll : 
When in the forest glades, by whispering streams, 
Your soft sighs breathe their music in my ear; 
When I repeat the vows I murmur'd, dear, 
In the wild, broken words of last nights' dreams; 
When on my trembling knees your forehead lies, 
And makes me happy with its sweet repose; 
And when your looks are fasten'd on my eyes, 
Just as a bee upon a summer rose, 
How often then, in my poor throbbing heart, 
I.feel some vague, some shadowy terror start;

You look me thro' with loving fears, 
Till your bright pearl-drops mingle with my tears — 
"Oh tell me, darling, of your hidden grief," 
You whisper, "Let me lull and soothe and calm, 
Till my sad heart gives your sick heart relief, 
With kisses long as death and words as soft as 
balm!" 
Ask me no more; sweet, when your soft arms twine, 
And lingering lips, and liquid eyes confess 
That every feeling of ..your heart is mine, 
I feel as stunn'd with too great happiness:

LOVE is not a feeling to pass away, 
Like the balmy breath of a summer-day; 
It is not — it cannot be — laid aside; 
It is not a thing to forget or hide. 
It clings to the heart, ah, woe is me ! 
As the ivy clings to the old oak-tree. 
Love is not a passion of earthly mould, 
As a thirst for honor, or fame, or gold; 
For when all these wishes have died away, 
The deep strong love of a brighter day, 
Though nourished in secret, consumes the more 
As the slow rust eats to the iron's core.

Unit Aak M( far a Pledge. ICuue 
VfOU ask me for a pledge, love, but gaze upon 
* my cheek, 
And let its hue, when thou art near, my heart's devotion 
speak; 
Look on my dim and tearful eye, my pale and rigid 
brow , 
List to my deep, unbidden sigh, — what need of 
pledge or vow ! 
You ask me for a pledge, love, some token of my 
troth; 
Take then this flower, an emblem meet of woman 's 
blighted youth; 
The perfume of its withered leaves, triumphant 
o'er decay, 
May whisper of my changeless love when I have 
passed away!

misery, 
I '11 be what I have ever been — to thee, to only 
thee!

Jrom "Mixvib" 
QUEEN rose of the rosebud garden of girls, 
Come hither, the dances are done, 
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, 
Queen lily and rose in one; 
Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, 
To the flowers, and be their sun. 
There has fallen a splendid tear 
From the passion-flower at the gate. 
She is coming, my dove, my dear; 
She is coming, my life, my fate; 
The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;" 
And the white rose weeps, "She is late;" 
The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;" 
And the lily whispers, "I wait."

Tis-Thy-Desert-Hath-Woone-My-Heart 
She is coming, my own, my sweet; 
Were it ever so airy a tread, 
My heart would hear her and beat, 
Were it earth in an earthly bed; 
My dust would hear her and beat, 
Had I lain for a century dead; 
Would start and tremble under her feet, 
And blossom in purple and red.

And her exquisite primrose face, 
And the violet in her eyes; 
And my heart received its own despair- 
The thrall of a hopeless grace, 
And the knowledge of how youth cues. 
Live hair afloat with snakes of gold, 
And a throat as white as snow, 
And a stately figure and foot, 
And that faint, pink smile, so sweet and cold, 
Like a wood-anemone cloud below 
The shade of an ilex root. 
And her delicate, milk-white hand in mine 
And her pensive voice in my ear, 
> 
And her eyes downcast as we speak.

To-Live-In-Love-I-Love-To-Live 
I am filled with a rapture vague and fine, 
For there has fallen a sparkling tear 
Over her soft pale cheek. 
And 1 know that all is hopeless now, 
And that which might have been, 
Had she only waited a year or two, 
Is turned to a wild regret, I know, 
Which will haunt us both, whatever the scene, 
And whatever the path we go. 
Meanwhile, for one moment, hand in hand, 
We gaze on each other's eyes, 
And the red moon rises above us. 
We linger in love with the lovely land — 
Italy, with its yearning skies, 
And its wild, white stars above us

yiME is pressing on us now. 
* Sowing wrinkles on each brow; 
If we must grow old in sooth, 
Keep we all we can of youth; 
But each step we take seems bringing 
Flowers in wild profusion springing, 
More than we can hope to hold, 
Friends, this is not growing old. 
Sparkling juice and merry song 
Gayly chase the hours along; 
Guests around our table may 
Whisper that our locks are gray, 
What care we if rosy wine 
Tells us of a youth divine, 
If our hearts are never cold; 
Friends, this is not growing old.

Does a laughing, roguish eye, 
Snare us, as in days gone by, 
Hinting, in a saucy fashion, 
Age is scarcely meant for passion — 
Less we love the less we spend, 
Of a mistress make a friend, 
Careless if she smile or scold; 
Friends, this is not growing old. 
If in spite of merry cheer 
Age should try to catch us here, 
Let us boldly, bravely meet him, 
All together we must greet him; 
So by our fireside, whenever 
Old age comes, we'll all together 
Jeer him back into the cold; 
Friends, this is not growing old.
